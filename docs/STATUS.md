# Project Status

Last verified: August 22, 2026

This is the authoritative source for the repository's current implementation
and validation status. `ROADMAP.md` describes milestone history and future
ideas; `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and `NEXT_STEPS.md` are retained as historical
development logs and should not be used to determine current priorities.

## Current State

The headless simulation engine and optional visualization stack are functional.
Implemented systems include world generation, zoning and growth, population,
traffic and commute routing, economy and trade, services and utilities
(including power generation capacity/source mix, water, and sanitation coverage),
district policy, public transit, disasters, crime and health, persistence,
replay verification, micro-traffic, metrics, CLI reporting, PPM rendering, and
the optional SDL2 visualizer.

Phase 1 through Phase 5 milestone work recorded in the roadmap is complete.
New work is post-backlog hardening, maintainability, profiling, and model
iteration rather than completion of a missing MVP subsystem.

### Shared full-sim path (CLI + visualizer)

- Default CLI `--ticks N` (with only size/seed/terrain options) now runs the
  same autonomous `CitySimulator` engine as `--simulate`, instead of an empty
  clock loop.
- Playable (player-built) cities use `PlayableCityTick` in `urban_sim_core`
  (growth, population, traffic + transit offload, services, pollution, land
  value, health, crime, waste, deathcare, economy, treasury); the SDL
  visualizer calls this shared step each live tick.
- `CitySimulator` also runs waste + deathcare each tick, auto-places Garbage/
  Cemetery with civic facilities, and records waste/deathcare on
  `SimTickMetrics` / `--simulate-report` CSV.
- Visualizer **G** toggles autonomous growth via the same
  `city_sim::expandConstruction` helper as `CitySimulator` (roads, pollution,
  zoning, empty-zoned pacing, civic facilities) then the playable tick stack;
  session save/load persists the G-mode flag and developed extent.
- HUD shows treasury cash (`$`) beside economy balance (`BAL $`, same metric as
  CLI `budgetBalance`).

### Recent performance work (post-MVP)

A multi-batch hot-path pass landed on `main` development:

- O(1) service result-cache validity (`EntityStore` mutation version)
- Chunked parallel pathfinding; A* over the road graph
- Lazy road nodes (no full-map node table)
- EntityStore type indices + O(1) capacity/count aggregates
- Zoning candidate list (no set→vector copy); incremental empty-zoned counter
- Spatial job sampling; multi-source service BFS by (type, radius)
- Dense land-value job distance field; active-region land-value averages
- Economy/population/service walks via type indices

## Validation Baseline

- 336 tests across the GoogleTest suites (authoritative: `ctest --test-dir build -N`).
- Tests are discovered individually by CTest.
- Regular and warnings-as-errors builds pass.
- Full ASan/UBSan and ThreadSanitizer runs pass.
- GitHub Actions runs strict Linux, macOS, and Windows jobs plus Linux
  ASan/UBSan and TSan jobs.
- CMake presets provide matching `regular`, `strict`, `asan`, and `tsan`
  configure/build/test workflows.

The authoritative live test list is produced by:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --show-only
```

Quick performance smoke (headless):

```bash
./build/bin/UrbanSimCore-cli --benchmark-phase5 50
```

## Current Priorities

1. Do not add a command/query façade until a second interactive frontend
   exists. Construction, playable-as-subset, and CLI-through-tools work
   from `ARCHITECTURE.md` is done.
2. Keep benchmarking large maps (`--benchmark-phase5`, multi-trial) after hot-path
   changes; guard regressions with release builds.
3. Further compile isolation of large CLI reporters (`GrowthPressureReport`,
   `CityPrinters`) only if build times become painful. Core orchestration is
   already split: `CitySimSupport`, visualizer modules, and CLI
   Options/Parse/EarlyDispatch/CityWorkflow + thin `main`/`CliApp`.
4. MSVC-first-class release packaging if Windows shipping is required (CI already
   builds Windows).
5. Model calibration and visualization polish driven by product goals, not the
   obsolete backlog slice order.

## Document Roles

- `STATUS.md`: current implementation, validation baseline, and priorities.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: implemented system boundaries and data flow (keep in
  sync with code).
- `ROADMAP.md`: milestone definitions, completed work, and future ideas.
- `MVP_SPEC.md`: original product scope and success criteria.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`: historical implementation journal.
- `NEXT_STEPS.md`: historical backlog sequence.
